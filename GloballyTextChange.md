In our app we can't change the text of the "Personalization" button for all products globally. If a client want to change them they need to change it one product at a time.
This below script will change the text of all of the Personalization Buttons in a store. Add this script in the theme.liquid file so this will apply to all products.

### Steps:

- Go to `theme.liquid` file and add this script.
- Change the value of "Your Text" in here cutomizeButtonText("Your Text") to client's desired text.
- Save and this change will apply on all of the Personalization Buttons.

**Use the following code:**

```js
<script type="text/javascript">

    // Listen for the pplrAppInitiated custom event
lizeButtonTextChange    window.addEventListener('pplrAppInitiated' , function(e) {

	  // bulk edit customize button text
	  function cutomizeButtonText(text){
		// The text you want to show on all personalization button
        let value = text;

        let btn = document.querySelector(".pplr-c-button");

        btn.textContent = value;
      };


      // Call the function and pass the value
      cutomizeButtonText("Your Text");
    });

  </script>
```
