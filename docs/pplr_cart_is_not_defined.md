## pplr_cart is not defined

If we get these errors in console

```
pplr_cart is not defiend
pplr_shop_currency is not defiend
pplr_enabled_currencies_size is not defiend
pplr_money_formate is not defiend
pplr_manual_theme_selector is not defiend
```

Then check, 
1. Is script loaded?
2. Does the below variables are declared or not?
```
var pplr_cart = 
var pplr_shop_currency = 
var pplr_enabled_currencies_size = 
var pplr_money_formate = 
var pplr_manual_theme_selector
```

Possible Solution:
Give auto install for that store.
